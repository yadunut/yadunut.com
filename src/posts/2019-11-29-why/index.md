Why am I writing this blog?

## Practice

I am horrible at putting my thoughts and ideas into words. What better way of
improving than practicing this. Not only that, having a log of thoughts / ideas
that I've worked on before is a good reference to have. Writing also helps to
develop ideas further, instead of staying in the preliminary stages in my head.

## Log

Having a log of things that I've done is amazing. I can use to see what I've
done in the past and see my personal growth hopefully :)
